# MicroBlogger

A workflow for Alfred 3 which facilitates posting to Micro.blog.

## Usage

This script enables easy posting to Micro.blog on MacOS directly from Alfred. Setting it up is very easy.

* Head over to your account page at Micro.blog and create a new App Token: click on "Edit Apps", enter the name of this workflow ("MicroBlogger") in the "App Name" field, and generate a new token.
* Download [the workflow](https://github.com/jbwhaley/MicroBlogger/blob/master/MicroBlogger.alfredworkflow), and double-click on the file to install it.
* Open an Alfred prompt, type in `mbauth ` (with a space), paste your API key into the prompt, and hit the return key. MicroBlogger is now authenticated.
* Now you can just type `mb ` in an Alfred prompt, type your post, and hit return. There you go.
